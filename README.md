## Key ideas:

- The Essence OMG Standard (see https://www.omg.org/spec/Essence/1.2/About-Essence) provides a solid ground for defining software development practices.
- Although Essence could eventually be used for organizational purposes, the standard is focused on the health progression of software engineering endeavors.
- For this context, a software architecture evaluation is an endeavor aiming at the software architecture "fitness" assessment in regard of the purpose the software system was conceived for.
- The Essence extension available in this repository aims to guide the progression of any software architecture evaluation endeavor, be it stand-alone or part of a major software product engineering.
